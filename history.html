        <h2>From tiny beginnings...</h2>
        <p>In 2017, new coach Abigail Heiser was asked to stick around after her first fall season at Lincoln
            High School as a winter guard coach for the Indoor Percussion group. Saying yes, she spent a season
            learning about the ins and outs of being part of putting together a winter show, and had a great time.
            The following season, the drumline coach informed her that the percussion students needed some extra focus, 
            and was encouraged to continue running the winter guard as their own program. In a fit of bravery, Abby 
            decided to see if the group could try attending a competition in their local circuit, HWAA.
        </p>
        <p>That season marked the inaugural season for the competitive Winter Guard program (as far as we know, the first
            public school competitive winter guard from Lincoln). Once again a learning experience, the guard managed to get 
            7th place out of 8 in the only competition they attended - still considered a major victory as their 
            only goal had been to not get last place.</p>
        <p>The following season saw the guard grow as a team, only to be cut down in their prime as the season ended 
            with the Covid-19 pandemic. The following two years saw a struggle to maintain membership before finally disbanding
            completely with Abby's "retirement" from coaching.
        </p>
        <h2>...through explosive growth...</h2>
        <p>But that retirement didn't last long, as Abby couldn't help but return 3 years later to Lincoln High's siren call. That 
            winter, she and new assistant coach Layne Larabee restarted the winter guard, this time including several students from
            other LPS schools that weren't able to field their own teams. This season (2024-2025) marked the first time the group ever 
            competed for a full season, attending 3 competitions and going to their first HWAA Championship.</p>
        <p>Following the end of that season, the team was informed that they could no longer allow students from other schools to 
            participate by the LPS administration... and in another fit of bravery, Abby and Layne decided to take the plunge into 
            creating an independent guard that would still allow them to serve all of Lincoln's students, as well as expand
            to include students from outside of the city limits. Choosing the name "Supernova" to represent the "Star City" of Lincoln,
            the new guard was officially formed as a nonprofit on September 4th, 2025.</p>
        <h2>...to a beautiful new beginning!</h2>
        <p>The 2025-2026 will be the first season as a completely independent guard... join us and become part of our history!</p>
