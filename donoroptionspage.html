            <div class="conContainer">
             <p>While our members pay participation dues, those fees don't cover all of our operational 
                expenses... donations, fundraisers and sponsors help make up the difference. Your 
                charitable gift will allow Supernova to continue offering youth and young adults in
                south-east Nebraska and the surrounding area. A general fund donation 
                will help us pay for rehearsal space, equipment, staff pay, props/accessories, and other 
                things as needed. Thank you for donating to Supernova Winter Guard! Your support, no 
                matter the size, truly makes a huge impact on our organization and the communities we 
                serve.</p>

            <p>Supernova travels to compete with other color guards in the mid-west region. 
                As with any competitive team, there are membership costs to participate 
                including uniform expenses, equipment, competition fees, facility rental fees, 
                etc. If you'd like to sponsor a specific member of our guard, choose this 
                option to make your contribution go towards covering your selected member's dues for 
                the season!

                summer months and better prepare for future seasons! There's a few different levels to choose from,
                so pick the one that best suites your ability to give (and maybe even get something tangible for it!).
