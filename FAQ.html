                    <h2>WHAT DO AUDITIONS CONSIST OF?</h2>
                    <p>Auditions usually take place in November. First we have an audition clinic
                         so that auditionees can learn skills needed for the audition itself, as well 
                         as for our coaches to get to know people and see their interpersonal skills. 
                         During the second week, after a couple hours learning/relearning the audition 
                         routine, we will have the actual audition portion which consists of performing 
                         the routine in front of the coaches. Once auditions are complete, you will 
                         receive an email about your membership in a few days.
                    </p>

                    <h2>WHEN AND HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF I HAVE MADE SUPERNOVA FOR THE SEASON?</h2>
                    <p>Supernova will contact everyone via email within 2-5 days after auditions.

                    <h2>DO YOU ACCEPT VIDEO AUDITIONS?</h2>
                    <p>It is important that we see how you interact with others to determine 
                        if you are a good fit for the guard. Because of this, we will not accept video auditions. </p>

                    <p>Yes… although in very strict circumstances, we will make an exception. If you 
                        have previously worked with either of the coaches and therefore, they know 
                        you well enough to determine if your personality is a good fit, you can reach 
                        out about missing the first weekend (this will still put you at a potential 
                        disadvantage for the following audition weekend if we start teaching the 
                        routine at the audition clinic).

                        remove heavier articles of clothing, as your body warms.  You may wear 
                        dance shoes or dance in your bare feet. Hair must be pulled back and out 
                        of the face in a ponytail or bun, and jewelry is not to be worn.

                    <h2>DO I NEED PRIOR GUARD OR DANCE EXPERIENCE TO AUDITION?</h2>
                    <p>While it will certainly help, it is not required that you have done guard or 
                        dance before. Everyone has to start somewhere, and maybe you'll take to it like a fish to water!

                    <p>Not at all!  These are skills that are season/show dependent, and typically learned 
                        by more advanced members. If we decide to use these pieces of equipment, we will teach 
                        it during the season.

                    <h2>SHOULD I AUDITION IF I AM INVOLVED IN OTHER ACTIVITIES?</h2>
                    <p>That depends on your own ability to balance your time well - and the only person that 
                        knows that is you. Attendance at all rehearsals and performances is mandatory for all 
                        members. Even if you are working, attending school, involved in another school activity, 
                        or having family functions, one must understand that you are making a season-long 
                        commitment to be a performer with Supernova, and missing time from practice and performances 
                        is detrimental to the team's success. Time management of your education, activities, family, 
                        and social life must allow you to dedicate the required week nights and weekends to the team. 
                        In the interest of being understanding, we will allow ONE regular season (NOT Championships) 
                        missed performance for another activity. If you have prior commitments that will cause you to 
                        miss more than one competitive performance, you should reconsider your membership for a later 
                        season. Failure to adhere to this policy will result you in being demoted to a Swing, or 
                        potentially full removal from the team. Part of the audition process involves filling out a 
                        conflict sheet so that we can see if your schedule will work with ours.

                    <h2>SHOULD I AUDITION IF I AM NOT IN SHAPE/NOT FLEXIBLE?</h2>
                    <p>Yes! While being flexible and in good physical form already will certainly help, you will get 
                        stronger, more flexible, and better endurance over the course of the season. The biggest 
                        things we're looking for at auditions are your ability to pick-up/learn new skills and 
                        choreography, your work ethic, and your ability to be a team player.

                    <p>Supernova is a non-discriminatory organization and while we encourage the participation of 
                        students of all backgrounds, we strongly recommend that students not audition if they have 
                        severe medical issues due to the very physical nature of the activity. You know yourself best - 
                        if your condition will hinder your ability to keep up with the team or put you (or others) in 
                        danger if it acts up during a performance, it might be best to be a part of the team as a 
                        volunteer helper.

                    <p>Absolutely; many winter guard members around the US are currently college students and/or 
                        working part time or full time jobs. It is a commitment and will require a lot of time management, 
                        but it is definitely possible. It comes down to you knowing how well you can balance your time.

                    <p>Winter Guard International Policy reads:</p>
                    <p>“WGI discourages independent color guards from utilizing membership composed of any high

                        and have not yet graduated.”</p>
                    <p>We will in no way recruit students from local high school programs that have a Scholastic Winter 
                        Guard. We strongly believe this rule fosters the growth of many local high school winter guard 
                        programs. Exceptions can be made if your high school does not have a competitive winter guard program

                    <p>Click here for the 2026 Calendar.  Winter Guard practice will start Monday, December 1st. 
                        Typically practices will be every Monday and Wednesday night from 6-8:30 pm. We often have 
                        an extended couple days of practice during winter break, depending on people's schedules, and 
                        then try to have at least an hour of rehearsal before leaving for competitions. Finals in our 
                        circuit are on April 4th, but we will have a Showcase with the other Lincoln winter guards 
                        sometime during the weeks following, depending on the groups' schedules. We anticipate being done 
                        before the start of May.

                    <p>It varies from week to week, and depends on the time of the season. Every week expect to 
                        have at least 5 hours (2.5 on Monday and 2.5 on Wednesday), as well as time you are 
                        putting into practice on your own (this is an expectation in order for the whole 
                        team to succeed). We expect to run at least one fundraiser each month, which might 
                        take anywhere from 1 to 10 hours depending on what they are. Competition days (roughly 
                        5 per season) are about 10 hour days, from practice beforehand to the end of awards.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Stretching</li>
                            <li>Flag warmup</li>
                            <li>Across-the-floors/dance technique</li>
                            <li>Learn/cleaning routine/drill</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>There is typically at least one if not two 5-10 minute breaks each night, 
                        where we might do a game/bonding activity. These are usually about every 50 
                        minutes to break up rehearsal/give performers a chance to rest. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>WHERE WILL REHEARSALS BE LOCATED?</h2>
                    <p>Supernova will be having a majority of its rehearsals in the Lincoln area for the 
                        2026 season. Exact locations will be provided after acceptance to the team.

                    <h2>HOW OFTEN WILL WE PERFORM?</h2>
                    <p>We will perform at 4 regular season competitions, and also the Heartland Winter Arts 
                        Association Championships; all of these typically are in Omaha or the surrounding towns 
                        (actual locations are still being decided on by the circuit). We plan to have a 
                        post-competition season Showcase with the other two Lincoln teams somewhere in Lincoln 
                        (UNL and Standing Bear). There may be other performances beginning in mid-January, 
                        depending on opportunity - we will keep performers updated as we find out performance 
                        chances.

                    <h2>WHAT DOES A COMPETITION DAY TYPICALLY LOOK LIKE?</h2>
                    <p>Competition days typically start out with an hour practice in Lincoln, then traveling to 
                        the competition site. We aim to arrive at least an hour before our scheduled performance 
                        time, although depending on start time, this may not always be possible. Once we are there, 
                        we go through a warm-up /practice timeline that leads up to our performance, which lasts 
                        about 7 minutes. Depending on our scheduled performance time, we may watch some of the other 
                        guards either before or after our performance. We may also stay for awards, depending on 
                        our scheduled performance time.

                    <h2>HOW MUCH ARE ANNUAL DUES? HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</h2>
                    <p>Unfortunately, we won't have a specific cost calculated until we know how many members 
                        we'll have. A few things that affect costs are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uniforms</li>
                            <li>Flags/equipment/props</li>
                            <li>Flags/equipment/props</li>
                            <li>Music Licensing</li>
                            <li>Circuit/competition fees</li>
                            <li>Rehearsal space rental</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>To give a rough estimate, Millard North's Varsity Guard's dues are around $950. Many independent 
                        guards can range from $1000 to as much $3000 per season. We plan to keep costs as low as we can, and 
                        expect that costs would be closer to Millard North's.

                        Our fundraising programs offer the ability to pay down your dues speedily and take 
                        the strain and stress out of paying the majority of your payments. We are also planning 
                        several fundraisers to help offset costs, including a couple of restaurant nights, 
                        wrapping paper night, a bingo/raffle night, as well as a few others.  All members are 
                        required to participate in team fundraisers.

                    <h2>WHAT IF I DECIDE I DON'T WANT TO DO WINTER GUARD AFTER THE SEASON STARTS?</h2>
                    <p>This is a team sport that only succeeds if EVERYONE on the team is committed and doing their 
                        best to achieve that success. This is why it is VERY important that you ask yourself before the 
                        season begins if you are up for the challenge and ready to make that commitment. It is frustrating 
                        for the staff to have to rewrite choreography and drill, and it is frustrating for your teammates to 
                        have to relearn things if you drop out. It's frustrating for potential members who wanted to be on 
                        the team that missed out on the chance because a limited spot was given to you instead. You know 
                        yourself best - if you already don't think you have the time/energy/headspace to take this on, don't 
                        try-out.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you do get accepted to the team and realize you don't want to do it anymore, please come talk to a 
                        staff member about your reason(s) so we can see if there is any solution to them. If you are still 
                        committed to dropping out after discussing with a staff member, you will be released from the 
                        team with NO refund on any member fees paid so far, but will be exempt from paying anything further. 
                        Depending on your reason, this may bar you from auditioning at Supernova in the future.
