            <h3>There are two audition dates (both are required!):</h3>
            <ul class="star-list">
                <li>11/16/25  - 1pm - 5pm</li>
                <li>11/23/25  - 1pm - 5pm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Doors open at 12:15pm, check-in begins at 12:30pm</p>
            <p>If you are a high school student and your parent/guardian has 
                questions or would like to meet us, we will be available during check-in.</p>
            <p><address>Norris High School - High School Gym<br>
                25211 S 68th St Basecamp 1,<br> 
                Firth, NE 68358</address></p>
            <h5>DIRECTIONS FOR PARKING/INSIDE BUILDING</h5>
            <p>When heading south towards the Norris campus, continue past Princeton Road. 
                There are 2 turn-ins to the high school, which is the East-most building on 
                campus. The parking lot is located on the West side of the high school. This 
                is the front of the school. Please enter the main doors (Door #11) and continue 
                forward once inside. Halfway down the hall on your right are the doors to the 
                gym we will be using.</p>
            <h5>PLEASE FILL OUT THE REGISTRATION FORM AND CONFLICT CALENDAR PRIOR TO AUDITIONS - REQUIRED</h5>
            <p>Registration is open from 10/27/25 - 11/14/25. Please fill out both parts from the links below (those using the
                audition clinic as a practice experience do not need to fill out a conflict calendar). Failure to fill out both
                will result in an incomplete registration and prevent you from being able to audition.</p>
                <h6><a href="https://forms.gle/PdQBSegu9qy23nBB9">Registration Form</a></h6>
                <hr>
                <h6><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dAHrB62kfFnI-yl-Ui16Fx8typLlML5ikXekRZM_xxk/copy?usp=sharing">Conflict Calendar</a></h6>
            <p>Supernova auditions are fun and casual! You'll learn original dance and flag 
                choreography, meet new people, and grow your skills! By the end of the first day 
                you'll have a handle on the skills needed for week two's audition, which you can 
                spend practicing throughout the week leading up to it; week 2's audition date will 
                consist of learning the routine, practicing for an hour or so, and then small group 
                performances assessed by the Supernova staff. We will be looking for hard working, 
                passionate team players that enjoy a friendly learning environment and those willing 
                to contribute their best effort consistently. Your work ethic and how well you work 
                with others factor heavily in our decision on if you make it.</p>
            <p>Audition Experience: Not auditioning, but want to see what it's like or use the audition 
                as a spin clinic? Select "Experience/Practice" when registering.</p>
            <p>Please wear all black, form-fitting, and non-revealing attire so that staff are able to 
                view your body lines. Hair should be pulled back, out of the face, and secured. You may 
                dance in indoor dance shoes or bare feet, depending on your preference.</p>
            <p>Please bring your own equipment & water, as well as snacks if desired. Bring kneepads and 
                any wraps that are needed for support. Remember, this is a SPORT!</p>
            <p>Can't make auditions? If you'd still like to be considered for a spot, please contact 
                Abby Heiser prior to November 9th, 2025.</p>

        <!-- <div>
            Upon arrival at the first clinic, potential members 
            will be provided with a membership handbook that further outlines expectations 
            and requirements of membership along with a legally binding contract to be signed 
            before membership can be granted.
        </div> -->

                <h2>Try-Outs are DATE and TIME</h2>
                <p>At tryouts you will learn a few flag basics and advanced moves, as well 
                    as some beginner dance. You will learn a short routine, which you'll 
                    perform on the final day for us so we can see your ability to perform 
                    for an audience.  Your work ethic and how well your work with your 
                    others will also go into our decision on if you make it. 
                </p>
                <p>If your parent/guardian has questions or would like to meet us, 
                    we will be available about 15 minutes beforehand.

                    heads up of how many flags we need to have prepared (you may want to bring 
                    your own just in case!). You can still show up even if you don't let us 
                    know beforehand though, so don't stress if you forget!
