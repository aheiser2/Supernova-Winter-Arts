    <h1>Ready to Join Supernova?</h1>
        <main class="column">
            <h3>There are two audition dates (both are required!):</h3>
            <ul class="star-list">
                <li>11/16/25  - 2pm - 6pm</li>
                <li>11/23/25  - 2pm - 6pm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Doors open at 1:15pm, check-in begins at 1:30pm</p>
            <p>If you are a high school student and your parent/guardian has 
                questions or would like to meet us, we will be available during check-in.</p>
            <p><address>Norris High School - High School South Gym<br>
                25211 S 68th St Basecamp 1,<br> 
                Firth, NE 68358</address></p>
            <p>DIRECTIONS FOR PARKING/INSIDE BUILDING: When heading south towards the Norris campus, continue past Princeton Road. 
                There are 2 turn-ins to the high school, which is the East-most building on 
                campus. The parking lot is located on the West side of the high school. This 
                is the front of the school. Please enter the main doors (Door #11) and continue 
                forward once inside. Halfway down the hall on your right are the doors to the 
                gym we will be using.</p>
            <p>Supernova auditions are fun and casual! You'll learn original dance and flag 
                choreography, meet new people, and grow your skills! By the end of the first day 
                you'll have a handle on the skills needed for week two's audition, which you can 
                spend practicing throughout the week leading up to it; week 2's audition date will 
                consist of learning the routine, practicing for an hour or so, and then small group 
                performances assessed by the Supernova staff. We will be looking for hard working, 
                passionate team players that enjoy a friendly learning environment and those willing 
                to contribute their best effort consistently. Your work ethic and how well you work 
                with others factor heavily in our decision on if you make it.</p>
            <p>If you'd like, the audition packet below contains more information about the season:</p>

            <p>Audition Experience: Not auditioning, but want to see what it's like or use the audition 
                as a spin clinic? Select "Experience/Practice" when registering.</p>
            <p>Please wear all black, form-fitting, and non-revealing attire so that staff are able to 
                view your body lines. Hair should be pulled back, out of the face, and secured. You may 
                dance in indoor dance shoes or bare feet, depending on your preference.</p>
            <p>Please bring your own equipment & water, as well as snacks if desired. Bring kneepads and 
                any wraps that are needed for support. Remember, this is a SPORT!</p>
            <h5>PLEASE FILL OUT THE REGISTRATION FORM AND CONFLICT CALENDAR PRIOR TO AUDITIONS - REQUIRED</h5>
            <p>Registration is open from 10/27/25 - 11/14/25. Please fill out both parts from the links below (those using the
                audition clinic as a practice experience do not need to fill out a conflict calendar). Failure to fill out both
                will result in an incomplete registration and prevent you from being able to audition.</p>
