                <h2>Try-Outs are DATE and TIME</h2>
                <p>At tryouts you will learn a few flag basics and advanced moves, as well 
                    as some beginner dance. You will learn a short routine, which you'll 
                    perform on the final day for us so we can see your ability to perform 
                    for an audience.  Your work ethic and how well your work with your 
                    others will also go into our decision on if you make it. 
                </p>
                <p>If your parent/guardian has questions or would like to meet us, 
                    we will be available about 15 minutes beforehand.

                <h2>Let us know you're coming if you can!</h2>
                <p>Text or email both work! While not required, this will give us a 
                    heads up of how many flags we need to have prepared (you may want to bring 
                    your own just in case!). You can still show up even if you don't let us 
                    know beforehand though, so don't stress if you forget!
