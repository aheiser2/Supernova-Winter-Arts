        <h1>Our Mission</h1>

        <p>Supernova Winter Arts is an Independent A Class performing ensemble dedicated to 
            pushing the boundaries of artistry, athleticism, and storytelling. We use fun choreography, 
            stunning visuals, and powerful music to bring our audiences into the story we're creating on the 
            floor and ignite their imagination. We strive to create an emotional connection that will 
            stay with them long after the performance is over.</p>
        <p>By establishing an Arts-centric program in the city of Lincoln, Supernova Winter Arts aims to 
            provide young people in lower southeast Nebraska and its surrounding 
            communities an exceptional performance experience based in an environment founded on 
            the ideals of dedication, creativity, and respect. We aim to provide our performers with
            a safe place to build their confidence, character, and self-esteem, and believe in the 
            valuable results of developing the mental, social, and physical health of our members. 
            We aim to help our members improve their quality of life, develop new life skills, give 
            them a sense of purpose and pride for their achievements, and lastly 
            empower them to pursue excellence both on and off the competition floor.</p> 
        <p>By joining a team comprised of young people representing all backgrounds, cultures, 
            and scholastic levels, our performers become well-rounded individuals, having 
            learned the values of collaboration and diversity to accomplish a singular goal. 
            Supernova Winter Arts supports diversity, equity, and inclusion for all. We truly believe 
            that while it's important to help students develop into amazing performers, 
            helping them mature into remarkable young adults who care for their fellow man and community
            is equally as valuable.</p>
