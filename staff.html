         <h3>Abigail Heiser (She/Her)</h3>
         <h2>Head Coach</h2>
         <p>Abby's three years in guard at LSW were (sadly) limited to just fall season.  
            After marching at UNL for five seasons and later becoming a coach for LHS's color guard, she 
            decided to live her dreams of starting the winter guard she never got to have in high school. 
            This winter will be her 12th season as a coach.</p>

         <h3>Layne Larabee (They/Them)</h3>
         <h2>Assistant Coach</h2>
         <p>Layne started color guard at LHS the same year Abby started as a coach. They performed for three years and served as section leader for two of them, 
          and after graduation spent one year in the UNL color guard. They were part of the first winter guard at LHS, and got to see it become a 
          competitive team; they were very excited to be part of bringing it back to LHS in 2025, and are looking forward to bringing winter guard to 
          everyone this season. This winter will be their fourth season as a coach.</p>
