                <h4>What is Winter Guard?</h4>
                <p>Winter Guard is an artistic sport similar to marching band,
                    but done inside a gym to recorded music. Winter guard
                    groups compete at different levels from novice to world
                    class, and are divided into two categories: scholastic and
                    independent. A show is between 3 to 7 minutes, and
                    usually has a theme or story. There are three main pieces of
                    equipment used in winter guard, as it grew out of the
                    military drill team tradition:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flag</li>
                    <li>Rifle</li>
                    <li>Sabre</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Supernova Winter Guard is currently preparing for
                our 2025-2026 season...  and we'd love to have you join
                our inaugural team!</p>
